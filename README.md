# Admin Dashboard

used react to create a front-end dashboard

```bash
npx create-react-app dashboard
```

## usage

you can run the website in vs-code using

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm start
```

there, you can see, the home page with 3 different components. header, sidebar and main-page containing dummy data and a graph.

i have used common class naming pactice like topbar\_\_title.

designed basic website with dummy-data

took reference from stack-overflow and youtube as well.

used color-code of 5 colors, #0b0c10 #1f2833 #c5c6c7 #66fcf1 #45a29e

within the time constraint and me not coding website since 4+months, website looks really dumb.

Looking forward to finish this website for myself.
